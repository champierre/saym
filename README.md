## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/saym.git
cd saym

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Set up your ElevenLabs API key
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Running saym

#### Option 1: Use npm/node directly (Recommended for development)

```bash
# Run with npm
npm run dev "Hello world"

# Or run the built version
node dist/cli.js "Hello world"
```

#### Option 2: Install globally

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g .

# Now you can use saym command
saym "Hello world"
```

#### Option 3: Create an alias

```bash
# Add to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
alias saym="node /path/to/saym/dist/cli.js"

# Reload shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc

# Now you can use
saym "Hello world"
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Note: Replace `saym` with `node dist/cli.js` if you haven't installed globally.

```bash
# Speak text using default voice
saym "Hello, world!"
# Or: node dist/cli.js "Hello, world!"

# Use a specific voice model by ID or name
saym -v "voice-id-or-name" "This is my custom voice"

# Read from file
saym -f input.txt

# Save output to file
saym -o output.mp3 "Save this speech to a file"

# Stream audio for real-time playback
saym -s "Stream this text as it's being synthesized"
```

### Voice Management

```bash
# List all available voices
saym voice list

# Create a custom voice model from audio samples
saym voice create -n "My Voice" -d "Personal voice model" -s sample1.mp3 sample2.wav sample3.m4a

# Delete a custom voice
saym voice delete <voice-id>
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Adjust voice parameters
saym --stability 0.8 --similarity 0.9 --style 0.2 "Fine-tuned voice output"

# Use different audio format
saym --format wav -o output.wav "Save as WAV file"

# Configuration management
saym config show                           # Show current configuration
saym config set defaultVoice <voice-id>    # Set default voice
saym config reset                          # Reset to defaults
```

### Creating Your Own Voice Model

1. **Prepare Audio Samples**
   - Record at least 30 seconds of clear speech
   - Use high-quality recordings (minimal background noise)
   - Supported formats: MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, FLAC
   - Maximum 25 files, 10MB per file

2. **Create Voice Model**
   ```bash
   saym voice create \
     --name "My Personal Voice" \
     --description "My custom voice for TTS" \
     --samples voice_sample_*.mp3
   ```

3. **Use Your Voice**
   ```bash
   # Use the voice ID returned from creation
   saym --voice <your-voice-id> "Hello, this is my voice!"
   
   # Or set as default
   saym config set defaultVoice <your-voice-id>
   saym "Now using my voice by default!"
   ```

## Configuration

Create a `.saymrc` file in your home directory for default settings:

```json
{
  "defaultVoice": "your-voice-id",
  "defaultLanguage": "en",
  "autoTranslate": true,
  "outputFormat": "mp3"
}
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ or Deno
- ElevenLabs API account and API key
- FFmpeg (for audio format conversions)

## API Key Setup

### 1. Create an ElevenLabs Account

1. Visit [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) and click "Sign Up"
2. Create an account using email or Google/GitHub authentication
3. Choose a subscription plan (Free tier available with limited usage)

### 2. Generate API Key

1. Log in to your ElevenLabs dashboard
2. Click on your profile icon (top right) ‚Üí "Profile + API Key"
3. In the API section, click "Generate API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key immediately (it won't be shown again)

### 3. API Key Configuration

#### API Key Management

ElevenLabs provides the following features for API keys:

- **Multiple API Keys**: You can generate multiple API keys for different environments
- **Key Regeneration**: Regenerate keys if compromised
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track API usage per key in the dashboard

#### Rate Limits by Subscription Tier

- **Free tier**: ~10,000 characters/month
- **Starter**: ~30,000 characters/month  
- **Creator**: ~100,000 characters/month
- **Pro**: ~500,000 characters/month

Note: Rate limits are applied at the account level, not per API key.

#### Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys to version control**
   ```bash
   # Add to .gitignore
   echo ".env" >> .gitignore
   ```

2. **Use environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Export in shell
   export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   
   # Option 2: Use .env file (recommended)
   echo 'ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"' > .env
   ```

3. **For production deployment**
   - Use secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
   - Use separate API keys for different environments
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Monitor usage in ElevenLabs dashboard

### 4. Verify API Key

Test your API key setup:

```bash
# Check if environment variable is set
echo $ELEVENLABS_API_KEY

# Test with saym
saym voice list
```
