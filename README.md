npm run dev "Hello world"

# Or run the built version
node dist/cli.js "Hello world"
```

# Now you can use saym command
saym "Hello world"
```

#### Option 3: Create an alias

```bash
# Add to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
alias saym="node /path/to/saym/dist/cli.js"

# Reload shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc

# Now you can use
saym "Hello world"
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Note: Replace `saym` with `node dist/cli.js` if you haven't installed globally.

```bash
# Speak text using default voice
saym "Hello, world!"
# Or: node dist/cli.js "Hello, world!"

# Use a specific voice model by ID or name
saym -v "voice-id-or-name" "This is my custom voice"

# Read from file
saym -f input.txt

# Save output to file
saym -o output.mp3 "Save this speech to a file"

# Stream audio for real-time playback
saym -s "Stream this text as it's being synthesized"
```

### Voice Management

```bash
# List all available voices
saym voice list

# Create a custom voice model from audio samples
saym voice create -n "My Voice" -d "Personal voice model" -s sample1.mp3 sample2.wav sample3.m4a

# Delete a custom voice
saym voice delete <voice-id>
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Adjust voice parameters
saym --stability 0.8 --similarity 0.9 --style 0.2 "Fine-tuned voice output"

# Use different audio format
saym --format wav -o output.wav "Save as WAV file"

# Configuration management
saym config show                           # Show current configuration
saym config set defaultVoice <voice-id>    # Set default voice
saym config reset                          # Reset to defaults
```

### Creating Your Own Voice Model

1. **Prepare Audio Samples**
   - Record at least 30 seconds of clear speech
   - Use high-quality recordings (minimal background noise)
   - Supported formats: MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, FLAC
   - Maximum 25 files, 10MB per file

2. **Create Voice Model**
   ```bash
   saym voice create \
     --name "My Personal Voice" \
     --description "My custom voice for TTS" \
     --samples voice_sample_*.mp3
   ```

3. **Use Your Voice**
   ```bash
   # Use the voice ID returned from creation
   saym --voice <your-voice-id> "Hello, this is my voice!"
   
   # Or set as default
   saym config set defaultVoice <your-voice-id>
   saym "Now using my voice by default!"
   ```

## Configuration
